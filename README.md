Introduction to the Command Line
=====================

## What is the command line?

## Why is it awesome?

Control! You can type commands out and control _exactly_ what your computer is doing. 

## Set up your environment

We'll be using [Nitrous.IO](https://www.nitrous.io). This is a really powerful tool, and we're only using a small part of it for this workshop. Definitely feel free to play with some of its functionality on your own! 

You can set up your account before the workshop, if you want! [Here are directions](https://github.com/anchorageprogramming/intro-to-command-line/blob/master/APW-NitrousIO.pdf?raw=true).
